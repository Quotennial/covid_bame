==============================

Analysis into the disproportionate impact of Covid-19 on different groups [through the prism of race](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/04/genetics-bame-people-die-coronavirus-structural-racism). 


Subnational level data is used from the amazing Yin Lin who curates this data daily: [Daily updated facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/groups/224857015370702/)

Ethnicity data obtained from [2011 census](https://www.ethnicity-facts-figures.service.gov.uk/uk-population-by-ethnicity/national-and-regional-populations/regional-ethnic-diversity/latest#data-sources)
(could use from the BAME report?)
